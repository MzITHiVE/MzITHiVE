* Interested in the dynamics and development of components 
* I always try to increase my knowledge in .Net language as much as possible 
* It will be interesting for me to learn new languages such as Angular, ASP.Net MVC [Frontend], Node JS and new technologies such as Apache Kafka very soon hopefully in the next five years 
* There's no place like 127.0.0.1
